Description: yEnc encoding/decoding extension for Python
 The yEnc module provide a simple API for doing raw encoding/decoding of
 yencoded binaries, mainly for retrieving or posting to the usenet.
 This implementation is really simple and intended mainly as an exercise
 to the author but is also significatively faster than any possible pure
 Python implementation and it's being actually used by some Python nntp
 clients out there.
